# AuthenticationSystem
A basic web application having the following features:
1. An authentication system.
2. Upload a file and save the data in the database.
3. Display the data saved in the database(use styling and themes as required).

The users must be able to login and logout of the system. You can use any form of authentication for this.
Create a panel to upload a JSON file (shared separately) add validations for the type of
file, the content of the file, etc. Parse and save this data to the database.
